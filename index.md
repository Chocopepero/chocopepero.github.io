### CSUF Fully Hacks 2024

* Godot Indie Game
  https://github.com/ACM-Game-Dev/FullyhacksSpring2024

    At Cal-State Fullerton's FullyHacks Hackathon, I worked with 3 of the CSUF ACM Game Dev board to work on an indie game.
  The theme of this hackathon was Neon so we decided to create a top down arcade style game as a Neon Green slime that
  can stand by radioactive barrels to charge up and glow brighter. The enemies would be neon red, blue, and yellow to complete
  the theme. I personally worked on the enemy logic and created a blue Melee-based enemy, a red Range-based enemy, and a
  yellow "Siphoner" enemy that would target your barrels around the game area in-order to pose as a threat. This was my
  first Hackathon as well as my first videogame project. Given that we had just under 24 hours to complete the project, I felt
  that I was forced to adapt and learn extremely quickly, learning both the Godot Engine as well as the associated Godot Script
  Language.

* CSUF CPSC121 Food Waste Tracker Project
  https://github.com/Chocopepero/CSPC121-Project
  
    My CPSC121 class was a course on Object Oriented Programming and as part of the course, we created a project that has a
  web-based front end where users input their food waste on any particular day and it get saved to the server as a JSON. Users
  could generate a report of their food waste and have it display several things such as: Their most wasteful mealtime, what food
  they wasted the most of, the most common reason for waste, how much food they wasted in USD, and suggestions on how to reduce waste.
  This project was part of an initiative at CSUF to combine Social Justice and Computer Science. I worked on the code that took the
  user's input, turned it into a JSON, and the logic for the report that was generated when the user clicked on the generate report button.

* Advent of Code 2023
  https://github.com/Chocopepero/AdventOfCode2023
  
    In the holiday season of 2023 I was challenged to particpate in AdventOfCode, an independently run puzzle challenge that presents
  challenges that can be solved by manual analysis, but has so many test cases that it would be unrealistic to solve these puzzles within 24 hours.
  Each day had a puzzle with two parts, part 1 introduced a problem while part 2 adds additions contraints. Due to the 2023 holiday season being
  so busy, I only managed to do a few days, but it was a great challenge and I plan on participating next year.
