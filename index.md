### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was interesting as it had expanded upon the HiLo game
    we as a class had been working on in several other labs. First it was
    an input based game, then it was based off command line arguments,
    and finally this version was based off of a separate .dat file.
    It felt great learning how to expand our programs and give them
    expand-ability.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was an incredibly difficult initially. Due to sickness
    I didn't have a lab partner and I was unable to collaborate with other
    students. However, being faced with a mental wall forced me to
    consider the problem from a different angle and it helped me
    understand 2D vectors far better.

* Lab 11

    In general, part 1 of the labs were generally easier than part 2.
    However, lab 11 was different in that part 1 was far more challenging
    than part 2. This lab challenged my understanding of 2D vectors
    that I acquired in the previously mentioned lab 10. This lab helped
    solidify my understanding and help me gain confidence in my abilities.
