          I’m Samuel Kim, a passionate and driven individual transitioning from
          a career as a Pharmacy Technician at San Antonio Regional Hospital to
          pursuing my love for technology as a Computer Science student at
          California State University, Fullerton.
          <br></br><br></br>
          My experience in the
          healthcare industry has equipped me with a unique blend of skills.
          I’ve developed the ability to work within a team under
          high-pressure environments, ensuring precision and efficiency in every
          task. At the same time, I’ve honed my critical thinking and
          problem-solving abilities, empowering me to make independent decisions
          and adapt to new challenges. 
          <br></br><br></br>
          Now, I’m utilizing those skills in the
          world of computer science, where I’m eager to combine my analytical
          mindset with technical expertise. I’m particularly passionate about
          leveraging technology to create innovative solutions that improve
          lives, whether it’s through developing software, designing systems, or
          tackling complex problems.
